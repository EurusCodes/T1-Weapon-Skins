# Starsiege: Tribes Weapon Skins
Weapon skins created with various AI generation tools for the game Starsiege: Tribes

## How To Use
Each folder in this repository represents a collection of skins. The folder names don't mean much other than a way to categorize the packs of skins.
To use the skins in Starsiege: Tribes
1. Make a backup of your Tribes `..\base\entities` folder. If you don't do this, you may lose your original skins.
2. Copy the contents of one of the repository folders into your Tribes `..\base\entities` folder.
3. Load Tribes and you should see the new skins.
